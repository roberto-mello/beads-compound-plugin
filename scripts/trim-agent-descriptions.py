    # Review agents (14)
    "kieran-rails-reviewer": "Rails code review enforcing strict conventions: inline turbo streams, proper namespacing, service extraction signals, testability, naming clarity, and duplication over complexity. Use after implementing or modifying Rails code.",
    "agent-native-reviewer": "Reviews code for agent-native compliance - ensuring any user action has an agent equivalent, and agents see what users see. Checks action parity, context parity, and shared workspace design.",
