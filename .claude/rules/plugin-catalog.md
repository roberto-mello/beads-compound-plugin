## Subagent Integration

When delegating work to subagents, include BEAD_ID in the prompt:

```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose",
     prompt="Investigate OAuth flow. BEAD_ID: BD-001")
```

The `subagent-wrapup.sh` hook will:
1. Extract BEAD_ID from the subagent transcript
2. Block completion until subagent logs knowledge
3. Prompt with the five knowledge prefixes (LEARNED/DECISION/FACT/PATTERN/INVESTIGATION)
